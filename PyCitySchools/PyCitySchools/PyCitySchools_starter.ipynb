    "Schools with higher per student budgets tend to have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher percentages of students passing both subjects. However, Cabrera High School, with a per student budget below $585, has higher average math and reading scores, as well as a higher overall passing rate compared to Bailey High School, which has a per student budget between $585 and $630.\r\n",
    "It appears that Charter schools, such as Cabrera High School with 1,858 students, tend to have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher passing rates compared to larger schools like District Bailey High School, with 4,976 students\n",
    "In conclusion, this trend suggests that smaller schools may provide a more conducive learning environment for students, leading to better academic outcomes.\n",
